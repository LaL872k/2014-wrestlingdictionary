# 2014-wrestlingdictionary

Approximate Development Time: July-August 2014

This program was designed in July/August of 2014. It was one of my first programs that incorporated reading and writing to files.
It allows the user to make "wrestling moves" that are then saved to individual files containing the name of the move, a description, 
when the move was added, and a youtube link to demonstrate the wrestling move.

To use the program, 
1. [download the zip file](https://github.com/LaL872k/2014-wrestlingdictionary/archive/master.zip)
2. unzip the file
3. run `compiled-version/Wrestling_Dictionary_2.jar`
